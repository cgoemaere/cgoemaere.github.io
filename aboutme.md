title: About me
---


Hi there, I'm CÃ©dric.

I'm a third-year PhD student at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) and part of the [T2K group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/), supervised by prof. [Thomas Demeester](https://tdmeeste.github.io/).

My research focuses on developing stable machine learning algorithms for analog electronics.
Specifically, I am currently working on scaling-up Predictive Coding models in a principled manner.
Before this, I explored Hopfield networks, Equilibrium Propagation, and their connection with Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs).

I'm always open to collaborations and unpaid[^1] internships, so feel free to contact me via email or Twitter. My contact details can be found at the bottom of the page.

## Personal life
In my free time, I'm mostly occupied with:

 - Volunteering at [Kazou](https://www.kazou.be/) as part of the board and as (chief) camp counselor
 - Running recreationally (HM in 1:54:31)
 - Catching up with friends
 - Travelling, as often as possible
 - Watching a movie and then looking up its Trivia section on IMDB

[^1]: I'm fortunate to hold a personal [FWO fellowship](https://www.fwo.be/en/fellowships-funding/phd-fellowships/phd-fellowship-fundamental-research/) to fund my endeavors until late 2027. As a result, I'm not allowed to receive remuneration from any other institute for work related to my research.
